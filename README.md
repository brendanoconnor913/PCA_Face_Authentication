# PCA_Face_Authentication
Face authentication system using Principal Component Analysis 

In mode 1 the first 5 of 10 images in each class is used for training data and the subsequent 5 are used to calculate FRR. In mode 2 all 10 images of the first 25 classes are used to 
for training data and the remainin 15 classes are used to calculate the FAR. Images are the graphs of FAR and FRR at varying values for the rejection threshold. The classification uses the nearest neighbor 
and the threshold is the maximum allowable distance from the nearest neighbor.
